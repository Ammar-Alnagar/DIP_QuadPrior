Introduction
DIP_QuadPrior is a project focused on improving image enhancement using a deep image prior approach combined with quad priors. This technique leverages the strengths of deep learning and prior knowledge about image structures to enhance image quality. The project aims to address various image restoration tasks, such as denoising and deblurring, by incorporating quad priors to better capture and restore fine details in images.

Features
Quad Priors Integration: Utilizes quad priors to incorporate knowledge about image structures and patterns, enhancing the restoration process.
Deep Image Prior: Employs deep learning models that use the image's inherent characteristics as a prior, leading to improved image quality and detail restoration.
Versatile Enhancement: Suitable for various image enhancement tasks, including noise reduction, deblurring, and overall quality improvement.
High-Quality Restoration: Delivers high-quality results with enhanced clarity and detail, particularly in challenging conditions such as low-light or noisy images.
Customizable Parameters: Provides options to adjust parameters and settings to fine-tune the enhancement process according to specific requirements.
Real-Time Processing: Designed for efficient processing, allowing for real-time or near-real-time image enhancement.
Comprehensive Documentation: Includes detailed guides and examples for setting up and using the DIP_QuadPrior model, processing images, and integrating the solution into various applications.
